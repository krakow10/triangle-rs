# Asked ChatGPT to write Rust code to draw a triangle with Vulkan
And here we are.

ChatGPT gave me this example code, and then I asked for the contents of the "triangle.vert.spv" file and it gave me some glsl code and told me to compile it with glslc, so I did that as well as ask for the other "triangle.frag" file.

ChatGPT has written a function "create_render_pass" and I've opted to call it with the argument vk::Format::R8G8B8_UINT

The code has like 20 errors and doesn't work at all lol this is garbage
